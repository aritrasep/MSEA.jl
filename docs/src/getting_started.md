# Getting Started #

```julia
using Modof, JuMP, MSEA
```

## Warm Up FPBH: ##

It is recommended that before `msea` is used for solving any biobjective pure integer program, `warmup_msea` is used to compile it.

```julia
warmup_msea(mdls=true) # To compile mdls as well ( MDLS should be properly installed )
```

```julia
warmup_msea(mdls=false) # To compile without mdls
```

## Using JuMP Extension: ##

Providing the following multi-objective mixed integer linear program as a ModoModel:

$$\begin{aligned} \min \: & x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 \\ \max \: & x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 \\ \min \: & x_1 + 2x_2 + y_1 + 2y_2 \\ \text{s.t. } & x_1 + x_2 \leq 1 \\ & y_1 + 2y_2 \geq 1 \\ & x_1, x_2 \in \{0, 1\} \\ & y_1, y_2 \geq 0 \end{aligned}$$

```julia
model = ModoModel()
@variable(model, x[1:2], Bin)
@variable(model, y[1:2] >= 0.0)
objective!(model, 1, :Min, x[1] + x[2] + y[1] + y[2])
objective!(model, 2, :Max, x[1] + x[2] + y[1] + y[2])
objective!(model, 3, :Min, x[1] + 2x[2] + y[1] + 2y[2])
@constraint(model, x[1] + x[2] <= 1) 
@constraint(model, y[1] + 2y[2] >= 1)
```

**Note:** Currently constant terms in the objective functions are not supported

### Using GLPK as the underlying LP Solver, and imposing a maximum timelimit of 10.0 seconds ###

```julia
@time solutions = fpbh(model, timelimit=10.0)
```

### Writing nondominated frontier to a file ###

```julia
write_nondominated_frontier(solutions, "nondominated_frontier.txt")
```

### Writing nondominated solutions to a file ###

```julia
write_nondominated_sols(solutions, "nondominated_solutions.txt")
```

### Nondominated frontier ###

```julia
nondominated_frontier = wrap_sols_into_array(solutions)
```

## Using LP File Format ##

Providing the following multiobjective mixed integer linear program as a [LP file](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.1/lp-format.htm):

$$\begin{aligned} \min \: & x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 \\ \max \: & x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 \\ \min \: & x_1 + 2x_2 + y_1 + 2y_2 \\ \text{s.t. } & x_1 + x_2 \leq 1 \\ & y_1 + 2y_2 \geq 1 \\ & x_1, x_2 \in \{0, 1\} \\ & y_1, y_2 \geq 0 \end{aligned}$$

### Format: ###

1. The first objective function should follow the convention of [LP format of single objective optimization problem](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.1/lp-format.htm)
2. **The other objective functions should be added as constraints with RHS = 0, at the end of the constraint matrix in the respective order**
3. Variables and constraints should also follow the convention of [LP format of single objective optimization problem](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.1/lp-format.htm)

```julia
write("Test.lp", "\\ENCODING=ISO-8859-1
\\Problem name: TestLPFormat

Minimize
 obj: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4
Subject To
 c1: x1 + x2 <= 1
 c2: x3 + 2 x4 >= 1
 c3: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4  = 0
 c4: x1 + 2 x2 + x3 + 2 x4  = 0
Binaries
 x1  x2 
End\n") # Writing the LP file of the above multiobjective mixed integer program to Test.lp
```

### Using GLPK as the underlying LP Solver, and imposing a maximum timelimit of 10.0 seconds ###

The sense of the first objective function is automatically detected from the LP file, however the senses of the rest of the objective functions should be provided in the proper order.

```julia
@time solutions = fpbh("Test.lp", [:Max, :Min], timelimit=10.0)
```

### Using CLP instead of GLPK as the underlying LP Solver, and imposing a maximum timelimit of 10.0 seconds ###

```julia
@time solutions = fpbh("Test.lp", [:Max, :Min], lp_solver=ClpSolver(), timelimit=10.0)
```

## Using MPS File Format ##

Providing the following multiobjective mixed integer linear program as a [MPS file](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/mps-format.htm):

$$\begin{aligned} \min \: & x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 \\ \max \: & x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 \\ \min \: & x_1 + 2x_2 + y_1 + 2y_2 \\ \text{s.t. } & x_1 + x_2 \leq 1 \\ & y_1 + 2y_2 \geq 1 \\ & x_1, x_2 \in \{0, 1\} \\ & y_1, y_2 \geq 0 \end{aligned}$$
