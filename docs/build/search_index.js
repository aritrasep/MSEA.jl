    "text": "This is a Multi-Stage Exact Algorithm for computing the true nondominated frontier of a Bi-objective Pure Integer Linear Program. Important characteristics of this algorithm are:Can solve any (both structured and unstructured) biobjective pure integer linear problem.\nA biobjective pure integer linear program can be provided as a input in 4 ways:\nModoModel - an extension of JuMP Model\nLP file format\nMPS file format\nMatrix Format ( Advanced )\nAll parameters are already tuned, only timelimit is required.\nSupports parallelization"

    "text": "It is important to note that the whole ecosystem has been tested using Julia v0.6.2 and hence we can cannot guarantee whether it will work with previous versions of Julia. Thus, it is important that Julia v0.6.2 is properly installed and available on your system. CPLEX must be available in the local machine and CPLEX.jl must be properly installed, otherwise the installation will fail. Once, Julia v0.6.2 and CPLEX.jl has been properly installed, the following instructions in a Julia terminal will install MSEA.jl and its dependencies on the local machine:Pkg.clone(\"https://github.com/aritrasep/MSEA.jl\")\nPkg.build(\"MSEA\")In case Pkg.build(\"MSEA\") gives you an error on Linux, you may need to install the GMP library headers. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian and similar, give the following command from a terminal:$ sudo apt-get install libgmp-devAfter that, restart the installation of the package with:Pkg.build(\"MSEA\")"
